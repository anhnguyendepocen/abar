Gradient boosted machines (GBMs) are an extremely popular machine learning algorithm that have proven successful across many domains and is one of the leading methods for winning Kaggle competitions. Whereas random forests (Chapter \@ref(RF)) build an ensemble of deep independent trees, GBMs build an ensemble of shallow and weak successive trees with each tree learning and improving on the previous. When combined, these many weak successive trees produce a powerful “committee” that are often hard to beat with other algorithms. This chapter will cover the fundamentals to understanding and implementing GBMs.

## Prerequisites

For this chapter we’ll use the following packages:

```{r gbm-prereq-pkgs}
library(rsample)  # data splitting
library(gbm)
library(caret)
library(vip)
library(pdp)
```


To illustrate the various concepts we’ll continue focusing on the Ames Housing data (regression); however, at the end of the chapter we’ll also apply fit a random forest model to the employee attrition data (classification).

```{r gbm-prereq-data}
# Create training (70%) and test (30%) sets for the AmesHousing::make_ames() data.
# Use set.seed for reproducibility

set.seed(123)
ames_split <- initial_split(AmesHousing::make_ames(), prop = .7)
ames_train <- training(ames_split)
ames_test  <- testing(ames_split)
```


## The basic idea


## Gradient descent


## Fitting a basic GBM


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# train GBM model
gbm_mod1 <- gbm(
  formula = Sale_Price ~ .,
  distribution = "gaussian",
  data = ames_train,
  n.trees = 10000,
  interaction.depth = 1,
  shrinkage = 0.001,
  cv.folds = 5,
  n.cores = NULL, # will use all cores by default
  verbose = FALSE
  )  

print(gbm_mod1)
## gbm(formula = Sale_Price ~ ., distribution = "gaussian", data = ames_train, 
##     n.trees = 10000, interaction.depth = 1, shrinkage = 0.001, 
##     cv.folds = 5, verbose = FALSE, n.cores = NULL)
## A gradient boosted model with gaussian loss function.
## 10000 iterations were performed.
## The best cross-validation iteration was 10000.
## There were 80 predictors of which 45 had non-zero influence.
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get MSE and compute RMSE
sqrt(min(gbm_mod1$cv.error))
## [1] 33079.61

# plot loss function as a result of n trees added to the ensemble

  interaction.depth = 3,
  shrinkage = 0.1,
  cv.folds = 5,
  n.cores = NULL, # will use all cores by default
  verbose = FALSE
  )  

# find index for n trees with minimum CV error
min_MSE <- which.min(gbm_mod2$cv.error)

# get MSE and compute RMSE
sqrt(gbm_mod2$cv.error[min_MSE])
## [1] 23813.34

# plot loss function as a result of n trees added to the ensemble
gbm.perf(gbm_mod2, method = "cv")
```
